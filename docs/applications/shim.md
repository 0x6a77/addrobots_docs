## Shim Application

The shim application simply passes motor commands to/from Google Compute (Firebase) to the local motor with no local processing at all. These kinds of applications will not be able to take advantage of the local smartphone capabilities (cameras, IMU, GPS, touch-screen UX, etc), but for many simple control applications this may be perfectly suitable. A silly example is an Internet-controlled cat feeder.
